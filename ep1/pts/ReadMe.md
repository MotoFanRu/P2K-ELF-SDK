ElfPack v1.x Patterns
=====================

This directory contains a set of binary function pattern files, which greatly simplify the search for functions in the phone's firmware and make the process of porting ElfPack to other Motorola phones easier. The **[`pat`](../../tool/src/pat/)** utility is used to work with pattern files.
