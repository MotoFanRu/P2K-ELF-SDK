Andy51 is happy to release FBrowser ELF v0.6!

What's new since v0.5:
+ Fixed all known bugs from v0.5 release, thanks all the testers!
+ Fixed menu & soft order
+ FBrowser moved to 'MotoMixer' menu entry (instead of 'SyncML')
+ Added prompts and notices
+ Added bookmark functionality (only one). Select 'Add Bookmark' to make
  the current directory bookmarked, and 'Bookmark' to make the bookmarked
  directory current.
+ Added 'Delete' file operation (for files only)
+ 'Back' button is now works as 'directory up'
+ 'Back' buton in the root folder will exit FBrowser
+ Red button press will now exit FBrowser and get you to the previous menu
  (instead of exit to idle screen)
+ ELF launch will now exit FBrowser, to avoid conflicts
+ Empty 'Installed' list is now shown as an 'Empty' list entry (instead of
  no-reaction)
+ Config file is now created in the same dir as elf
+ Added compatibility with 'Delete unwanted folders from phone' patch (empty
  spaces in files list fix)

- Long filename truncation bugs
- Bug: if you'll exit FBrowser in the folder with ~100+ files, it wouldn't
  start. To fix: delete the file 'FBrowser.cfg' in the FBrowser's dir

Some notes for v0.5:
  FBrowser is an ELF, originally intended to launch other ELFs, not to do file
  ops! File operations is a secondary functionality!

Installed list functionality:
  To make the ELF manageent more convenient, 'Installed' ELF list is developed.
  Adding to that list is not actually 'Installing', it gives nothing except
  the useful ELF list. Once again, installing is not necessary, make it if you
  want to have a full list of ELFs in your phone. 'Delete' in the 'Installed'
  list only removes the ELF from it, it doesn't delete the file. Also you can
  view some file properties from the list.
