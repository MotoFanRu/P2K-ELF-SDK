ElfPack v1.x Resource Files
===========================

The ported ElfPack requires several resource files to function correctly on the Motorola P2K phones.

* **[auto.run](auto.run)**:

  ElfPack's startup script file, in which the ELF launcher must be registered.

* **[elfloader.lib](elfloader.lib)**:

  ElfPack's firmware-dependent functions library generated by **[kitchen](../../tool/kitchen/)** scripts.

## ELF Launcher

A popular and simple early ELF launcher, **FBrowser v0.6** by **Andy51**, was closed-source, prompting other developers to create alternatives.

**Two variants of FBrowser v0.6**

* The **[original variant](FBrowser.elf)** released by Andy51 on 28-Oct-2007, does not work if the `elfloader.lib` library has the `A _ll_cmpu` function.
* The **[patched variant](FBrowser/FBrowser.elf)**, released by Macho on 04-Sep-2008, works if the `elfloader.lib` library has the `A _ll_cmpu` function.

The icons in both variants of the FBrowser launcher have been changed to match the style of Motorola P2K phones.
