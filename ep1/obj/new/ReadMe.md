ElfPack v1.x New Object Files
=============================

The new ElfPack precompiled object files extracted from the `obj.zip` archive included with **libgen 6.5**, released by **Macho** on 19-Aug-2009.

## New features

* ElfPack can now automatically search for `elfloader.lib` and `auto.run` files on various phone's file system disks.
* Pressing "0" during power-up allows skipping autorun process on R373.
* Fixed an issue where non-existent ELF executables caused startup problems.

Addressing remains unchanged, ensuring compatibility between these object files, existing ELF patches, and new libraries.

## Additional information

* libgen update 6.5 (16642/16504)
